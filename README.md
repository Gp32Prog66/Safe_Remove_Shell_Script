# Safe_Remove_Shell_Script

## Running the Program
You will need to allow file permissions for this program to work in a Unix/Linux environment.
Type `chmod u+rwx saferm.sh` to allow read, write, and execute permissions to the owner.
You can also type `chmod 777 saferm.sh`, but proceed with caution as this grants read, write,
& execute permissions to everyone in the system

### Execute the Script
Type `./saferm.sh` to your file path on where the shell file is located
If you need to exit the program at any time, type `ctrl + c`.
